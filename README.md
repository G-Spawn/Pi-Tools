# Pi-Tools

This is my little space for adding helpful scripts to help you with your Raspberry Pi. No garuetees that theyll work for everyone, but if you do have an issue, do let me know. 

# Pi Infoz

Simply run this program. Shows basic stats of the Pi. Includes time, tempatures, IPs, and CPU Usage. 

# PiHole Backuper

Little script that copies and zips your /etc/pihole directory and saves it to your home folder.
