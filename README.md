# Pi-Tools

This is my little space for adding helpful scripts to help you with your Raspberry Pi. No garuetees that theyll work for everyone, but if you do have an issue, do let me know. 

# Pi Infoz

Simply run this program. Shows basic stats of the Pi. Includes time, tempatures, IPs, and CPU Usage.                                       
*NOTE: If you are running Raspian Stretch, USE THE STRETCH VERSION, and use the Buster version for Buster, however the changes are minor so if you for some reason feel then need to do so, everything except the Local IP will work.*

# PiHole Backuper

Little script that copies and zips your /etc/pihole directory and saves it to your home folder. Great for if you disabled the Webmin interface to free up apache/lighttpd for another use.
